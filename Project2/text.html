<div class="title">The Punking of Paris Hilton</div>
<div class="subheading">Bansky</div>

<p>Duration: 3 min, 22 sec
<br>
<br>
Hundreds of Paris Hilton albums have been tampered with in the latest stunt by "guerrilla artist" Banksy.<br>
Banksy has replaced Hilton's CD with his own remixes and given them titles such as:
<br>
Why am I Famous?, What Have I Done? and What Am I For?
<br>
He has also changed pictures of her on the CD sleeve to show the US socialite topless and with a dog's head. A spokeswoman for Banksy said he had doctored <em>500 copies</em> of her debut album Paris in <em>48 record shops<em> across the UK. She told the BBC News website:
<blockquote>"He switched the CDs in store, so he took the old ones out and put his version in."</blockquote></p>
